# memory-management
Attempt to implement memory management in an OS

This is a little project I worked on in my free time (this is NOT a University project). 

What I tried to do is to implement various memory management strategies
We can  either swap processes from main memory to disk or load the process pages in depending on the chosen memory management strategy. Both strategies are implemented and test-covered.

The main objective of this project is to gain more experience writing test cases using TestNG
