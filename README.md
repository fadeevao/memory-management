# memory-management
Attempt to implement memory management in OS

This is a little project I worked on in my free time (this is NOT a University project). 

What I tried to do is to immplement various memory management strategies as in an operating system. 
We can  either swap processes from main memory to disk or load the process pages in deepending on the chosen memory management strategy. Both strategies are implemented and test-covered. 

The main objective of this project is to gain more experience writing test cases using TestNG which I really liked in the end.

This is an interesting little project that I really enjoy working on.
